# Portfolio
Hi, my name is Hira Ali. Since 2021 I have been working as a SQA Engineer. Its almost 3.7 years now. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses, self-study and my job. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation in, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.
