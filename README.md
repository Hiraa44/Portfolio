# Portfolio

**About Me**

Hi, my name is Hira Ali. Since 2021 I have been working as a SQA Engineer. Its almost 3.7 years now. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses, self-study and my job. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation in, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.

**Relevant Experience**

Being an Associate SQA Engineer at Synavos is my first professional position strictly in QA area. I have made a significant growth both in my tech and soft skills, such as strong analytical thinking and developped some know-how in test automation. In addition, to that I participated in clear and concise Test Case writing, execution of Test Cases and reproting results of testing to Project Manager and QA Lead. Also, learn different practices of doing regression testing and test cases prioritization. Worked on Web Application and Mobile (Android & IOS) applications. 

My second experience was with Strategic Systems International where my major testing was focused on Web Applications, API Testing and Database Testing. Involved testing on QA, UAT and Production servers. Participated in bug free timely production releases, involved in new requirment testing of assigned tasks during sprints and walk through the client from new requirments at the sprint end.

My third working experience is with Studies Weekly testing an LMS used by Teachers and Students. Invloved in production smoke, sanity and regression testing. New requiremnts and bugs testing(reported by teachers). Coordinating with developers for bug fixes. Also update test cases on daily basis. Coordinating with automation engineer to convey updates in Test Cases. Also attending stand ups on daily basis.
