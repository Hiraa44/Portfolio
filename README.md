#**About Me**

Hi, my name is Hira Ali. Since 2021 I have been working as a SQA Engineer. Its almost 3.7 years now. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses, self-study and my job. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation in, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.

Involved testing on QA, UAT and Production servers. Participated in bug free timely production releases, involved in new requirment testing of assigned tasks during sprints and walk through the client from new requirments at the sprint end.
